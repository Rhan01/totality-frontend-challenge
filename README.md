# Totality Frontend Challenge

## Project Overview
This project is a property rental platform built using React. It includes property listings, a booking management system, and a checkout process. The website is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Approach
We followed a modular approach to development, starting with setting up the React environment and project structure. The project was divided into key features: Property Listings, Booking Management, and Checkout Process. We ensured a responsive design to provide a seamless experience across devices.

## Tech Stack
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For navigation and routing.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **Axios**: For API calls and data fetching (if applicable).
- **Vercel**: For deployment.

## Features
1. **Property Listings**: Displays a list of properties with sorting and filtering options.
2. **Booking Management**: Allows users to book properties and manage their bookings.
3. **Checkout Process**: Calculates total costs and collects user details for booking confirmation.
4. **Responsive Design**: Optimized layout for various screen sizes.
